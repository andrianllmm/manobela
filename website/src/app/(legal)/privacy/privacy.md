# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Manobela** (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application **Manobela** (“App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Personal Information

We do **not** collect personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or contact details by default.

### 1.2 Camera and Sensor Data

The App requires access to your device’s camera to operate.

### 1.3 Optional Local Data Logging

If you enable optional data logging features, the App may store usage or monitoring data locally on your device only. This data is not automatically shared with us or third parties unless you explicitly authorize it.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect personal data by default, we primarily use data locally on your device to:

- Provide real-time driver monitoring and alerts
- Improve the App’s functionality (if you opt in to local logging)

---

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** share, sell, or rent your data to third parties.

We may disclose information only if required by law or if necessary to protect our rights, users, or others.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party libraries or services (for example, analytics or crash reporting tools). These services may collect certain technical information as required by their own privacy policies.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services. Please review their privacy policies directly.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect data stored locally on your device. However, no security system is completely secure.

We are not responsible for unauthorized access to your device or data if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised.

---

## 6. Your Choices

You may choose to:

- Revoke camera permission (the App may not function properly without it)
- Disable optional data logging at any time
- Delete the App and any stored local data

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Privacy Policy with a new “Last updated” date.

Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
